# Requirements

## Summary

You are building a personal finance web app where users will enter a
saving goal and monthly deposit will be calculated for them.

Your task is to simulate this environment and build:

1. The Front-End using [React](https://react.dev) and [mantine](https://mantine.dev).
2. The Back-End using the language and database of your choice.

## Web app structure

- The user will see a landing page with 2 buttons, register and login.
Once logged in will be redirected to the home page.

- The home page will view the created saving goals and an option
to create a new one,

- To create a new goal the user enter two fields:
  - The total amount to be saved
  - The date to reach the goal

- The monthly deposit value will be calculated and displayed.

- When the user changes any of the two values, the monthly
deposit value is recalculated and displayed for them.

## Example
- Total amount to be saved = $30,000
- The date to reach the goal = October 2025
- Current date = October 2023
- The monthly deposit value = $1,250 for 24 months
